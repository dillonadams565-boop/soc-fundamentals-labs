# Lab 6 — Vulnerability Scanning Awareness

## Objective
Demonstrate basic awareness of vulnerability scanning by identifying exposed services on a system and interpreting scan results at a high level.

## Environment
- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
- Tool: Nmap
- Scan Target: Localhost (127.0.0.1)

## Scope
This lab focuses on identifying exposed services only.  
No exploitation, credentialed scanning, or remediation was performed.

## Activity Performed
- Ran a TCP SYN scan to identify open ports.
- Identified services listening on open ports.
- Performed service version detection.
- Reviewed scan output to understand potential exposure.

## Commands Used
sudo nmap -sS 127.0.0.1  
sudo nmap -sV 127.0.0.1

## Findings
- Port 22/tcp was open and running SSH.
- Port 631/tcp was open and running IPP (CUPS).
- All identified services were expected for a standard Ubuntu system.
- No unexpected or unknown services were identified.

## SOC Interpretation
Basic scanning helps identify exposed services that could present risk if misconfigured or outdated.  
In a SOC environment, unknown open ports or unnecessary services would require further investigation.  
The results observed in this lab were consistent with normal system behaviour.

## Outcome
- No suspicious exposure identified.
- No escalation required.
