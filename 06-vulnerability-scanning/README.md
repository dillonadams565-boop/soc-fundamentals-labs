# Lab 6 — Vulnerability Scanning Awareness

## Objective
Demonstrate a basic understanding of vulnerability scanning by identifying exposed services on a system and interpreting scan results at a high level.

## Environment
- Operating System: Linux
- Tool Used: nmap
- Scan Target: Local host (127.0.0.1)

## Scope
This lab focuses on understanding the purpose and output of basic vulnerability and exposure scanning. No exploitation, credentialed scanning, or remediation was performed.

## Activity Performed
- Performed a TCP port scan against the local system.
- Identified open ports and listening services.
- Performed service version detection.
- Reviewed scan output to understand potential exposure.

## Commands Used
```bash
nmap -sS 127.0.0.1
nmap -sV 127.0.0.1
