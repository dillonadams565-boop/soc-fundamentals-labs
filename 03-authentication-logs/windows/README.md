# Lab 3 — Windows Authentication Log Review

## Objective
Review Windows Security logs to identify failed and successful authentication events and understand what normal local logon activity looks like from a SOC perspective.

## Environment
- Operating System: Windows
- Tool: Event Viewer
- Log Source: Windows Security Log

## Scope
This lab focuses on local authentication activity only. Controlled failed logon attempts and a successful logon were generated on the host system and reviewed.

## Events of Interest
- Event ID 4625 — Failed logon
- Event ID 4624 — Successful logon

## What Was Done
- Multiple failed logon attempts were generated by entering an incorrect password at the Windows lock screen.
- A successful logon was then performed using the correct credentials.
- Event Viewer was used to review the Windows Security log and locate the relevant authentication events.

## What Was Observed
- Multiple Event ID 4625 (failed logon) events occurred close together in time for the same user account.
- A subsequent Event ID 4624 (successful logon) event confirmed a successful authentication.
- The events originated from the local workstation and were consistent with normal user behaviour (mistyped password followed by a successful login).

## SOC Interpretation
A small number of failed logon attempts followed by a successful logon is typical of normal user activity. In a SOC environment, higher volumes of failed logons, failures across multiple accounts, or remote logon attempts would warrant further investigation.
