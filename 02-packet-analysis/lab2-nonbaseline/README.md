# Lab 2 — Non-Baseline Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective
Identify network traffic patterns that deviate from established baseline behaviour across DNS, TCP, and TLS.

## Scope
This lab analyses:
- DNS traffic anomalies
- TCP connection anomalies
- TLS session characteristics that differ from normal user browsing

## Environment
- Host OS: Windows
- Tool: Wireshark
- Network: Home network

## Method
Traffic will be intentionally generated to produce non-baseline patterns, captured using Wireshark, and analysed to determine whether the behaviour is suspicious from a SOC perspective.
