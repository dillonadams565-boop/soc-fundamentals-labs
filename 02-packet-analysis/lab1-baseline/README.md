# Lab 1 – Baseline Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective
Capture and analyse normal network traffic to understand standard request/response behaviour.

## Environment
- Host OS: Windows
- Tool: Wireshark
- Network: Home network

## Activity Performed
- Captured live network traffic
- Visited example.com and wikipedia.org during capture
- Observed DNS resolution, TCP handshakes, and HTTPS traffic

## Key Observations
- DNS queries preceded website access
- TCP three-way handshakes were observed before data transfer
- HTTPS traffic appeared encrypted, with no readable payload data

## Outcome
This lab establishes a baseline understanding of what normal network traffic looks like before analysing suspicious or malicious behaviour.
